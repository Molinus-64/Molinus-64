- 👋 Hi, I’m @Molinus-64
- 👀 I'm interested in many things but here are the main ones: programming (especially Python and web languages), 
music (I love listening to it and I even play it), and I also like all which revolves around the Warhammer hobby.
- 🌱 I am currently learning the c++ language which changes me compared to my habits, that is to say Python
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on any project, I'm very open. Contact me if you would like to collaborate on any 
project in Python language or web development
- 📫 How to reach me: you can send me an email at the email address leorouv@gmail.com
